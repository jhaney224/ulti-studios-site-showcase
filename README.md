# Ulti Studios Website

The Ulti Studios website is a full-stack, client-facing platform I designed and built to support my freelance Minecraft service, Ulti Studios. It showcases services, project offerings, plugin releases, and client onboarding information.

## 🌐 Live Site
[https://ultistudios.co](https://ultistudios.co)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Vue.js, HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Hosting & Deployment:** Netlify (static deployment with continuous integration via GitHub)

## 💡 Key Features
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices
- Overview of available services (plugin development, configuration, server setup)
- Client onboarding information and direct contact info
- Plugin listing and community engagement info

## 👨‍💻 My Role
I developed the entire website independently, from concept and design to deployment. This includes:
- Planning the content layout and structure
- Writing and styling the front-end using Vue.js and Tailwind
- Configuring domain and hosting via Netlify
- Maintaining and iterating based on client needs and feedback

## 📦 Context
The site supports **Ulti Studios**, an entrepreneur project I founded to deliver Minecraft-related services. Through Ulti Studios, I’ve published multiple Java-based Minecraft plugins (13,000+ downloads collectively) and provided custom server setups to clients.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Enhanced SEO and analytics for client acquisition
- And more to come!
